I faced a number of challenges with this assignment. I had a lot of issues getting various components to work correctly. I did a lot of research online and read a lot of documentation. I also reached out to resources such as classmates, tutpes, instructors, and TAs with questions to push the project forward. After a lot of research and work, I was able to put together the app.
